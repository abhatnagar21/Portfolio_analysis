This project performs financial analysis on a portfolio consisting of stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN) using Python. It calculates various metrics including annual return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, Value at Risk (VaR), and Portfolio Beta. Visualization of portfolio performance and correlation among stocks is also included.

Interpret Results:

Annual Return: Measures the portfolio’s performance over a year.
